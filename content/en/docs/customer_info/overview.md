The Mobile Sim Operators Plans API includes a customer information feature that provides access to bill payment
information for electricity and piped gas operators. This information is useful for customers who need to make payments
for these services and want to ensure that their bills are paid on time.

The customer information feature is accessible through the following endpoint:

- Electricity Customer Info
- Piped Gas Customer Info

This feature can help customers keep track of their bill payments, making it easier to stay on top of their bills and
avoid late payment fees. Additionally, by providing easy access to bill payment information, the Mobile Sim Operators
Plans API can help customers save time and effort that would otherwise be spent searching for this information
elsewhere.
