The Mobile Sim Operators Plans API includes an operator mapping feature that allows users to retrieve information about
a specific operator based on a provided number. This feature makes it easier for users to retrieve the correct
operator information, even if they are not familiar with the operator name.

The operator mapping feature is supported for prepaid, postpaid, and DTH plans. Endpoint URLs for each type of plan are
as follows:

- Prepaid Operator/Mapping
- Postpaid Operator/Mapping
- DTH Operator/Mapping
