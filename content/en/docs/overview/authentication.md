Our Mobile Sim Operators Plans API utilizes a token-based authentication system to secure access to the API. This means
that users must first create a unique token in the website panel before they can start making API calls.

To create a token, users must log into the website panel and follow the instructions provided. Once a token has been
created, it can be used in API requests to access the plans, operator mapping feature, and customer information.

The token-based authentication system provides an extra layer of security to ensure that only authorized users have
access to the API. It also allows for easy management of API access and the ability to revoke or regenerate tokens as
needed.

We highly recommend that users follow the steps outlined in the API documentation to create a token and securely use the
API.

By utilizing a token-based authentication system, we aim to provide a secure and convenient way for users to access and
utilize the Mobile Sim Operators Plans API in their projects.
