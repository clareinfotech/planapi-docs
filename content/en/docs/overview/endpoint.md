The endpoint for the Mobile Sim Operators Plans API is located at:

```bash
https://planapi.clareinfotech.com
```

This endpoint provides access to the latest plans information of various operators, including prepaid, postpaid, and
DTH. It also allows for the use of the operator mapping feature and access to customer information, including bill
payment information for electricity and piped gas operators.

To make API calls, you will need to append the endpoint with the necessary API endpoint, query parameters, and an API
token for authentication. The full API documentation is available on the website, which includes detailed information on
how to use the API and the specific endpoint URLs for each API feature.
